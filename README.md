# 🎸 Spotify Rock Music Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Rock music once dominated global charts and shaped cultural identity, but in recent years its mainstream visibility has declined. With the rise of streaming platforms, hip-hop, pop, and EDM have taken over the spotlight.  

This project explores:  
- Why has rock music faded in popularity in the streaming era?  
- What do Spotify’s track-level trends reveal about this decline?  
- What cultural and business lessons can we learn from rock’s transformation?  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology & Rationale  
- **Data Source**: Spotify API (track-level features including popularity, release year, tempo, duration, energy).  
- **Tool**: Tableau for visualization and interactive dashboards.  
- **Approach**:  
  - **Duration vs Popularity** → tested if track length impacts popularity.  
  - **Cohort Analysis** → compared older vs newer tracks.  
  - **Heatmap** → analyzed seasonal release patterns.  
  - **Popularity Trends** → tracked rise and decline from 2000–2025.  

**Rationale**: By combining track attributes with popularity metrics, the analysis aims to show not just **when** rock faded, but **why**.

## 📈 Key Insights & Narrative  

1. **Rock’s Peak and Decline**  
   - Mainstream peak: **2013–2016**.  
   - Decline aligns with rise of streaming-native genres (hip-hop, pop, EDM).  

2. **Heritage Carries the Genre**  
   - Catalog tracks stay popular, showing nostalgia drives much of rock’s relevance.  

3. **Streaming Culture Misfit**  
   - Rock is louder, less danceable, and less loopable than TikTok/playlist-ready tracks.  
   - This mismatch explains reduced algorithmic boost.  

4. **Live Music Dependency**  
   - Heatmaps reveal rock’s spikes around **touring and festival cycles**, proving its strength lies in live experiences.

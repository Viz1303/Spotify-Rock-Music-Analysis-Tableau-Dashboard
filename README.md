# The Decline of Rock: A Spotify Data-Driven Analysis

## Problem Statement  
Rock music once dominated global charts and shaped cultural identity, but in recent years its mainstream visibility has declined. With the rise of streaming platforms, hip-hop, pop, and EDM have taken over the spotlight.  

This project explores:  
- Why has rock music faded in popularity in the streaming era?  
- What do Spotify’s track-level trends reveal about this decline?  
- What cultural and business lessons can we learn from rock’s transformation?  

---

## Methodology & Rationale  
- **Data Source**: Spotify API (track-level features including popularity, release year, tempo, duration, energy).  
- **Tool**: Tableau for visualization and interactive dashboards.  
- **Approach**:  
  - **Duration vs Popularity** → tested if track length impacts popularity.  
  - **Cohort Analysis** → compared older vs newer tracks.  
  - **Heatmap** → analyzed seasonal release patterns.  
  - **Popularity Trends** → tracked rise and decline from 2000–2025.  

**Rationale**: By combining track attributes with popularity metrics, the analysis aims to show not just **when** rock faded, but **why**.

</p>  

*Insight*: Rock songs average 3–4 minutes like other genres, but lack the hook-heavy structure that fuels algorithmic virality.

### 2. Popularity Trends Over Time

</p>  

*Insight*: Popularity peaked between **2013–2016**, followed by a steady decline. Genres like hip-hop and EDM have since dominated Spotify charts.

</p>  

*Insight*: Older tracks (classics) maintain strong popularity → rock’s cultural pull is **heritage-driven**, not powered by new releases.

</p>  

*Insight*: Popularity spikes align with **festival seasons and album drops**, suggesting rock thrives more in **live performance spaces** than in streaming algorithms.

## Key Insights & Narrative  

1. **Rock’s Peak and Decline**  
   - Mainstream peak: **2013–2016**.  
   - Decline aligns with rise of streaming-native genres (hip-hop, pop, EDM).  

2. **Heritage Carries the Genre**  
   - Catalog tracks stay popular, showing nostalgia drives much of rock’s relevance.  

3. **Streaming Culture Misfit**  
   - Rock is louder, less danceable, and less loopable than TikTok/playlist-ready tracks.  
   - This mismatch explains reduced algorithmic boost.  

4. **Live Music Dependency**  
   - Heatmaps reveal rock’s spikes around **touring and festival cycles**, proving its strength lies in live experiences.

## Lessons Learned & Real-World Meaning  

1. **Technology Shapes Genres**  
   - MTV once fueled rock → now Spotify algorithms fuel hip-hop & pop.  

2. **Business Implications**  
   - Labels prioritize faster ROI genres.  
   - Rock artists must lean into **hybrid sounds** or **touring models** to stay competitive.  

3. **Cultural Evolution**  
   - Rock hasn’t died — it’s become a **heritage genre**, much like jazz.  

4. **Future Outlook**  
   - For revival, rock needs to embrace **cross-genre fusions** or fully own its niche as a **live-first genre**.
